### Hello Everyone!!

This repository is created for our ITSP Collage project. This file consist of codes and images related to our project. 

#### Short Description:
We have made a 2 wheeler bot which will move on a ground automatically(we will need to give 3-4 waypoints smartly such that the bot will cover the entire area provided). As the bot will move over the given area, it will make a 3d map of whatever area/objects that will come in front of it. The map will be an exact colored copy of that area over which it just wandered. We used ROS(Robot Operating System) topics to send commands to our bot. We used the RTAB-MAP package for mapping. We used a LaserScan sensor to know the distance of objects in front of the bot which was ultimately used for automation and we used depth camera for depth images which were used for mapping. All the simulation was done in Gazebo simulator. We can see the final 3d map on Rviz.
